# ADR-005: Document Deletion Functionality

## Status
Proposed

## Context

The `ama_b_viewer` application currently provides navigation and viewing capabilities for MongoDB documents. To enhance data management and provide full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, a mechanism for deleting individual documents is required. This feature introduces a significant change as it involves permanent data modification.

## Decision

It is decided to implement a document deletion functionality accessible via a dedicated button in the document navigation interface. This functionality will allow users to remove the currently viewed document from the MongoDB Atlas collection.

Key aspects of the implementation will include:

1.  **Frontend Integration:** A `[Delete]` button will be added to the existing document navigation bar (`templates/base.html`).
2.  **User Confirmation:** To prevent accidental data loss, the delete action will be preceded by a client-side confirmation dialog (e.g., JavaScript `confirm()`).
3.  **Backend Endpoint:** A new Flask route will be created (`main.py`) to handle the deletion request. This endpoint will receive the document ID and perform the deletion in the MongoDB collection.
4.  **Post-Deletion Redirection:** Upon successful deletion, the user will be redirected to a logical next state, such as the next available document, the home page, or a confirmation message.
5.  **Error Handling:** The backend will include robust error handling for cases where the document is not found or a database error occurs.

## Rationale

*   **Complete Data Management:** Provides essential functionality for managing the dataset directly within the application, moving towards a more comprehensive tool.
*   **User Control:** Empowers users to curate their data by removing irrelevant or erroneous entries.
*   **Simplicity of Access:** Integrating the delete button directly into the document view navigation makes the functionality easily discoverable and accessible.
*   **Safety Mechanism:** The confirmation dialog is a critical UX component to mitigate the risk of accidental data deletion, which is a high-impact operation.

## Consequences

*   **Data Permanence:** Deleted documents are permanently removed from the database. This necessitates careful consideration of user permissions and backup strategies in a production environment (though not part of this initial implementation).
*   **Backend Logic:** Requires new backend logic to interact with MongoDB for deletion.
*   **Frontend Changes:** Modifies the existing navigation UI.
*   **Security:** While not in scope for this initial feature, future considerations should include robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure only authorized users can delete documents.
