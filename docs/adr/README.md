# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains the **Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)** for the `ama_b_viewer` project. An ADR is a short document that describes an important architectural decision made during development.

## Purpose

ADRs serve to capture the context and reasoning behind significant decisions. This helps new developers understand *why* the system is built the way it is and prevents having to re-litigate past discussions.

## When to Create a New ADR

A new ADR should be created when a decision has a significant impact on the project, such as:

*   Introducing a new technology or framework (e.g., a new JavaScript library).
*   Changing the fundamental application architecture (e.g., introducing caching).
*   Establishing a major technical standard or pattern (e.g., our commit convention).
*   Implementing a large, self-contained feature.

Each ADR receives a sequential number (e.g., `ADR-003-...`).
