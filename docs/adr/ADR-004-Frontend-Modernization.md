# ADR-004: Frontend Modernization and UI/UX Improvements

## Status
Proposed

## Context

The current frontend implementation of the `ama_b_viewer` web application relies on simple, directly embedded CSS rules within HTML and minimal JavaScript. While functional for initial development, the design exhibits significant weaknesses in terms of aesthetics, usability, and maintainability. The appearance is outdated and utilitarian, lacking modern UI/UX patterns, and data presentation in some areas (e.g., raw JSON output) is suboptimal for end-users.

To make the application more professional and user-friendly, a comprehensive frontend modernization is required.

## Decision

It is decided to comprehensively modernize the frontend of the `ama_b_viewer` application to improve UI/UX and achieve a contemporary aesthetic. This includes the introduction of a modern CSS framework, improved data presentation, expanded interactivity, and general visual polishing.

The main components of this decision are:

1.  **Integration of a Modern CSS Framework:** An established framework such as **Bootstrap** will be introduced to ensure a consistent, responsive, and aesthetically pleasing design. This will enable the use of pre-built components and accelerate development.
2.  **Improved Data Presentation:** The display of raw data (especially JSON) will be replaced with more structured and visually appealing formats, e.g., formatted tables, cards, or badges, to enhance readability and understanding for the end-user.
3.  **Expanded Interactivity:** Filtering, sorting, and search functionalities will be implemented on dashboards and in the document view to facilitate data exploration and improve user control.
4.  **Visual Polishing:** A defined color palette, improved typography, and optimized spacing will be applied to create a more professional and cohesive appearance.
5.  **Navigation and Layout Optimization:** The navigation structure will be revised, potentially by introducing a sidebar for main navigation, to utilize available screen space more efficiently and improve the discoverability of features.

## Rationale

*   **Enhanced User Experience (UX):** A modern and intuitive frontend increases user satisfaction and facilitates interaction with the data.
*   **Professional Appearance:** An appealing UI is crucial for the perception of the application, especially if it extends beyond internal use.
*   **Development Speed and Maintainability:** Using a CSS framework reduces the effort for manual styling, promotes consistency, and simplifies frontend maintenance.
*   **Responsiveness:** Modern frameworks inherently provide good responsiveness, improving the application's usability across various devices.
*   **Future-Proofing:** A solid frontend foundation facilitates future extensions and the integration of new features.

The decision for Bootstrap is based on its widespread adoption, extensive documentation, and large community, which allows for quick onboarding and troubleshooting.
