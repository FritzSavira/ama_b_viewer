## 2025-07-28 - Feature: Filtered Data Views (VIEW-01)

### Overview
Implemented filtered data views for the MongoDB document viewer as per `FEATURE_VIEWS.md` specification. This includes "All", "Question", "Answer", "Tags", and "Question Abstraction" views. The frontend now uses a base template for consistent styling and structure.

### Key Changes & Rationale

1.  **`main.py` Modifications:**
    *   **Flask App Initialization:** Moved `app = Flask(__name__)` to an earlier point for better structure.
    *   **`show` URL Parameter:** Modified `@app.route('/')` and `@app.route('/view/<id>')` to accept an optional `show` query parameter, defaulting to `'all'`. This parameter is propagated through "Previous" and "Next" navigation links.
    *   **`ObjectId` JSON Serialization:** Added a custom Jinja2 filter `tojson` with a `CustomEncoder` to handle `bson.ObjectId` serialization to string, resolving `TypeError: Object of type ObjectId is not JSON serializable`. This ensures all document data can be rendered as JSON in templates.
    *   **Conditional Template Rendering:** Updated `view_document` function to render different templates (`index.html` or `question_abstraction_view.html`) based on the `show` parameter, promoting modularity and separation of concerns for different view types.

2.  **Frontend Template Refactoring (`templates/` directory):**
    *   **`base.html` Creation:** Introduced `base.html` to serve as a base template for all views. It contains common HTML structure, CSS styles, and the main navigation (Previous/Next buttons and tab navigation). This ensures a consistent look and feel across different views and simplifies future UI modifications.
    *   **`index.html` Adaptation:** Modified `index.html` to extend `base.html` and now only contains the specific content block for "All", "Question", "Answer", and "Tags" views.
    *   **`question_abstraction_view.html` Creation:** Created a new template file specifically for the "Question Abstraction" view. This template also extends `base.html` and implements the detailed, structured display of the `question_abstraction` field using `dl`, `dt`, `dd`, and `ul` elements, along with dedicated CSS for better readability.

### Files Modified
*   `main.py`
*   `templates/index.html` (modified)
*   `templates/base.html` (new)
*   `templates/question_abstraction_view.html` (new)

### Outstanding Issues / Next Steps
*   **Error Handling:** Enhance error handling for cases where sub-fields within `question_abstraction` might be missing or have unexpected types. Currently, `default('N/A')` is used, which is basic.
*   **Styling Refinement:** The current CSS is basic. Further styling could be applied for a more polished look, especially for the `question_abstraction` view.
*   **Test Coverage:** Add unit/integration tests for the new routes and template rendering logic to ensure stability and prevent regressions.
*   **Data Validation:** Consider adding data validation on the backend for incoming `show` parameters to prevent invalid view requests.
*   **Performance Optimization:** For very large documents, consider lazy loading or pagination within the views, though not critical for current scope.
