## 2025-07-28 - Refactor: Improved Answer View Logic

### Overview
Refactored the logic for the "Answer" view to robustly display content from a deeply nested field (`reply.completion.choices[0].message.content`). This change improves code quality and prevents potential runtime errors if the data structure varies.

### Key Changes & Rationale

1.  **`main.py` Modifications (Good Practice):**
    *   **Helper Function:** Introduced a new helper function, `get_answer_content(doc)`, to encapsulate the logic for safely accessing the nested answer field.
    *   **Robust Error Handling:** The function uses a `try...except` block to gracefully handle `KeyError`, `IndexError`, or `TypeError` if the expected path does not exist in the document, returning a user-friendly message instead of crashing.
    *   **Separation of Concerns:** The main route `view_document` is now cleaner, as it delegates the complex data extraction to the helper function, improving readability and maintainability.

2.  **`templates/index.html` Simplification:**
    *   The template logic for the "Answer" view was simplified to directly render the `answer_content` variable passed from the backend.
    *   This removes complex data access logic from the template, adhering to the principle of keeping templates focused on presentation.

### Files Modified
*   `main.py`
*   `templates/index.html`

## 2025-07-28 - Feature: "First" and "Last" Navigation Buttons

### Overview
Added "First" and "Last" buttons to the document navigation, allowing users to jump directly to the first and last documents in the MongoDB collection. This improves navigation efficiency, especially in large datasets.

### Key Changes & Rationale

1.  **`main.py` Modifications:**
    *   The `view_document` function was updated to retrieve the `_id` of the first and last documents from the collection.
    *   These IDs (`first_doc_id`, `last_doc_id`) are now passed to the template context, making them available for the navigation links.

2.  **`templates/base.html` Modifications:**
    *   Added "First" and "Last" buttons to the navigation bar.
    *   The buttons are logically arranged as `[First] [Previous] [Next] [Last]` for an intuitive user experience.
    *   The links correctly use the `first_doc_id` and `last_doc_id` passed from the backend.

### Files Modified
*   `main.py`
*   `templates/base.html`

## 2025-07-28 - Feature: Filtered Data Views (VIEW-01)

### Overview
Implemented filtered data views for the MongoDB document viewer as per `FEATURE_VIEWS.md` specification. This includes "All", "Question", "Answer", "Tags", and "Question Abstraction" views. The frontend now uses a base template for consistent styling and structure.

### Key Changes & Rationale

1.  **`main.py` Modifications:**
    *   **Flask App Initialization:** Moved `app = Flask(__name__)` to an earlier point for better structure.
    *   **`show` URL Parameter:** Modified `@app.route('/')` and `@app.route('/view/<id>')` to accept an optional `show` query parameter, defaulting to `'all'`. This parameter is propagated through "Previous" and "Next" navigation links.
    *   **`ObjectId` JSON Serialization:** Added a custom Jinja2 filter `tojson` with a `CustomEncoder` to handle `bson.ObjectId` serialization to string, resolving `TypeError: Object of type ObjectId is not JSON serializable`. This ensures all document data can be rendered as JSON in templates.
    *   **Conditional Template Rendering:** Updated `view_document` function to render different templates (`index.html` or `question_abstraction_view.html`) based on the `show` parameter, promoting modularity and separation of concerns for different view types.

2.  **Frontend Template Refactoring (`templates/` directory):**
    *   **`base.html` Creation:** Introduced `base.html` to serve as a base template for all views. It contains common HTML structure, CSS styles, and the main navigation (Previous/Next buttons and tab navigation). This ensures a consistent look and feel across different views and simplifies future UI modifications.
    *   **`index.html` Adaptation:** Modified `index.html` to extend `base.html` and now only contains the specific content block for "All", "Question", "Answer", and "Tags" views.
    *   **`question_abstraction_view.html` Creation:** Created a new template file specifically for the "Question Abstraction" view. This template also extends `base.html` and implements the detailed, structured display of the `question_abstraction` field using `dl`, `dt`, `dd`, and `ul` elements, along with dedicated CSS for better readability.

### Files Modified
*   `main.py`
*   `templates/index.html` (modified)
*   `templates/base.html` (new)
*   `templates/question_abstraction_view.html` (new)

### Outstanding Issues / Next Steps
*   **Error Handling:** Enhance error handling for cases where sub-fields within `question_abstraction` might be missing or have unexpected types. Currently, `default('N/A')` is used, which is basic.
*   **Styling Refinement:** The current CSS is basic. Further styling could be applied for a more polished look, especially for the `question_abstraction` view.
*   **Test Coverage:** Add unit/integration tests for the new routes and template rendering logic to ensure stability and prevent regressions.
*   **Data Validation:** Consider adding data validation on the backend for incoming `show` parameters to prevent invalid view requests.
*   **Performance Optimization:** For very large documents, consider lazy loading or pagination within the views, though not critical for current scope.
